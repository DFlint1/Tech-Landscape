    <h2>A Place For Mom</h2>
    <p>This job is looking for a Front End Developer to work with their small team and startup culture. It sounds like it would be fun turning photoshop designs into functioning websites and making an impact by helping seniors find care for themselves.

        <h2>Mindlance</h2>
        <p>This job is looking for an entry level Front End Developer/Software Developer to work with UI Engineers to build responsive and accessible web pages mainly in HTML, CSS and JavaScript which are the areas I like the most. It is for a shot project time being 12 months and that sounds ok since I donâ€™t necessarily need a permanent position.
